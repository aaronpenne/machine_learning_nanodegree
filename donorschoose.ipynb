Every application has questions 1 and 2, but the counts of questions 3 and 4 are significantly lower. Typically if there are large amounts of missing data in an attribute, it would be thrown out.

    "- `project_essay_3`: \"Describe how your students will use the materials you're requesting\"\n",

The old questions 1 and 2 ask about the classroom and students, while the new question 2 asks about the students and the school.
